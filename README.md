# Jwker

This is a command line tool to easily convert keys between the PEM and JWK file formats.

## Usage

ðŸš¨ JWK to PEM conversion is not supported yet ðŸ˜©

Convert from PEM to JWK format:

```bash
jwker my-key.pem > my-key.jwk
cat my-key.pem | jwker > my-key.jwk
```

A complete example for creating a new keypair, saving the public key as a JWK and the private key as a PEM, but with a passphrase:

```bash
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 \
| tee >(openssl ec -pubout | jwker > key.pub.jwk) \
| openssl ec -aes256 -out key.prv.pem
```

## Installation

If you have go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/jphastings/jwker
```
